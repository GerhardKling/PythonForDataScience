# Python for Data Science
The repository provides all the material for my YouTube course "Python For Data Science", which you find on YUNIKARN. The course introduces Python and its use in the context of data analysis, machine learning, and simulations.


# U1: Installing Python for Data Science
This video explains how to install Python for applications in Data Science. Anaconda is usually the favourite installation as it offers Python and R as well as several integrated development environments (IDEs). We also discuss alternative IDEs and text editors such as Sublime Text.

# U2: Your First Python Session
This video walks you through your first session in Python. We will use the Jupyter Notebook and the Spyder IDE. After installing Anaconda (see the first video of the playlist), you have access to Jupyter and Spyder. At the end of the video, we will discuss which IDE might be the best for work in Data Science. We cover assignments, the print and type function. We explain what "dynamically typed" means. At the end of the video, you will be able to start working in the Jupyter Notebook or Spyder.

# U3: Introduction to Booleans in Python
Are you telling the truth? In this video, we introduce Booleans. I show you how to assert relationships and assign Booleans. We cover logic (and, or, not) and the bool function.

# U4: Lists in Python
This video introduces lists. We start with an empty list and add items using the append method. The len function is discussed. Then we explore indexing, the pop method, and slicing. Finally, we briefly discuss shallow copies of lists and the reverse method.
