# Python for Data Science
The repository provides all the material for my YouTube course "Python For Data Science", which you find on YUNIKARN. The course introduces Python and its use in the context of data analysis, machine learning, and simulations.


# U1: Installing Python for Data Science
This video explains how to install Python for applications in Data Science. Anaconda is usually the favourite installation as it offers Python and R as well as several integrated development environments (IDEs). We also discuss alternative IDEs and text editors such as Sublime Text.

# U2: Your First Python Session
This video walks you through your first session in Python. We will use the Jupyter Notebook and the Spyder IDE. After installing Anaconda (see the first video of the playlist), you have access to Jupyter and Spyder. At the end of the video, we will discuss which IDE might be the best for work in Data Science. We cover assignments, the print and type function. We explain what "dynamically typed" means. At the end of the video, you will be able to start working in the Jupyter Notebook or Spyder.

# U3: Introduction to Booleans in Python
Are you telling the truth? In this video, we introduce Booleans. I show you how to assert relationships and assign Booleans. We cover logic (and, or, not) and the bool function.

# U4: Lists in Python
This video introduces lists. We start with an empty list and add items using the append method. The len function is discussed. Then we explore indexing, the pop method, and slicing. Finally, we briefly discuss shallow copies of lists and the reverse method.

# U5: Tuples & Sets in Python
This video introduces tuples and sets in Python. We start with empty tuples or sets and demonstrate the use of the plus operator (tuples) and the add method (set). The differences between tuples, sets and lists are made clear, exploring indexing, slicing, and the meaning of order. We see the unpacking of tuples in action, which is useful in many applications. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of different "containers" for data in the context of data science.

# U6: Dictionaries in Python
This video introduces dictionaries in Python. We explain how dictionaries can be used to store and extract values based on their keys. The update method permits adding new key-value pairs or updating values. The list function converts a dictionary into a list of its keys. Finally, we discuss the dict() constructor to build dictionaries from other data structures.

# U7: For & While Loops in Python
This video introduces for and while loops in Python. We start with for loops using range. Then we loop over iterable objects such as lists. Finally, we use while loops to construct Fibonacci numbers. While you watch this video, be careful not to enter an infinite loop as you might never escape!

# U8: Branching in Python: if - elif -else
This video introduces if - elif - else statements in Python, which are used in branching statements. We start with if statements and check the behaviour of our code after adding additional if statements and an else statement. Finally, we play around with else-if (elif) statement. If you are not confused by the end of this video, you are a real Pythonian!

# U9: First Python Project: User Input, Loops, and List Comprehension
Welcome to your first project in Python. Your coding challenge is to develop a Python code that takes the name of a customer using the terminal, adds food items to the order, and displays the total price to be paid. This is 20 minutes of fun using the input function, for loops over lists, a while loop, and list comprehension.
